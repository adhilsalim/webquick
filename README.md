# WebQuick

Generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript boilerplate with a live server.

## Installation

To use WebQuick as a global command-line tool, you can install it using npm. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g webquick
```

Once the installation is complete, you can use WebQuick from the command line by running `webquick`.

## Usage

### Generating Boilerplate

To generate boilerplate files for a new project, use the `generate` (or `g`) command followed by the project name. For example:

```bash
webquick generate myproject
webquick g myProject
```

This will create a new directory named `myproject` with the basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### Starting a Live Server

To start a live server for a project, use the `serve` (or `s`) command followed by the project name. For example:

```bash
webquick serve myproject
webquick s myProject
```

This will start a live server for the project, and you can access it at http://localhost:3000.
